# SleepXAI

SleepXAI: An Explainable Deep Learning approach for Multi-class Sleep Stage Identification <br />


#Follow the steps to run the SleepXAI model. <br />
#Download the dataset with the files present in the code folder. <br />
#Simply run "run.py" to generate four different models for EEG Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz signals with CNN-CNN and CNN-CRF models. Confusion matrices are also generated automatically with 20-fold cross-validation. <br /> 
#Generate hypnogram and grad-cam visualization with the code available. <br />
